# Lab2_DevOps
This Lab is all about the basics of Git/GitHub 
It tells us about each and every members of the group.
In this Lab we are given a use case that we have to form a group of 4 students.
Each student will create a file of his own name with an extension of .html
At the end a index.html we be there in which we will create hyperlinks with "Know About <name>"
